## 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Responsive design with media queries  

## 🚀 What I learned

During this project I learned how to:  
- Better handle media queries between 800px and 1000px  
- Use correct relative paths to load images on GitHub Pages  
- Prevent elements with `background-color` (such as `<main>`) from covering the body background  
- Organize files and folders in a cleaner way for deployment  
- Write a custom `README.md` to explain the project and request targeted feedback  

## 🤔 Challenges

The most difficult parts were:  
- Managing background patterns across desktop and mobile  
- Properly centering the cards at different screen widths  
- Understanding the difference between relative paths in CSS and in HTML
